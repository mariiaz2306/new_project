This project is a web application developed using React and Redux technologies. The goal of the project was to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for users to solve a specific problem or provide a specific service.

The application is based on React architecture, which provides a dynamic and efficient user experience. The Redux library is used to manage the state of the application, which allows you to effectively manage data and its flow in the application, providing predictability and ease of debugging, as well as reuse of actions.

The application is divided into functional, reusable components, which makes it possible to achieve convenience and reduce the amount of code in a larger project.

The following functionality was implemented as part of the project:
-adding products to the shopping card, navigating to it using a router browser, editing the number of products in it, deleting products, and sending an order to the backend. I still had many ideas for implementing additional features for using the application, such as: filtering and sorting prices, adding products to favorites and applying for an additional 5% discount on the first order, etc., but I decided not to implement this since it would take additional time resources.
Also, according to the technical specifications, a search for the desired product was carried out with the effect of reflecting suitable products in real time and the subsequent transition to the description of one product and adding it to the cart.

The interface is designed taking into account modern CSS design trends and provides easy navigation and a visually attractive user experience. In this project, I tried to clearly show my skills and knowledge in this area, for example, when demonstrating a banner, a page not found and a logo. I believe that in this work it was important to show not design solutions, but knowledge of stylization, even if they do not quite fit into the framework of the general style.

Also in this project, I made an additional header and footer that are unchanged throughout the entire application, which will help the user use all the necessary pages within reach.

Regarding your task that each user of the shopping cart should be unique, this is one of the solutions why I chose redux for this application, since it allows all states to be unique and is not violated by the redux state instance through a unique channel of use by the browser. In general, in my practice, such things have always been performed in the following combination: Firebase + REDUX TOOL KIT, this really allows the user to enter his personal account and carry out all manipulations in this way. But at this stage, I considered it sufficient to use the redux state; if you have any other views on this matter, I am ready to discuss them and redo this point in the project.

Also in this project, I additionally added local storage logic using </PersistGate>, which helps save user actions throughout the entire session of using the application.

The basic adoptation for a different screen resolutions also had been  implemented, not a perfect one, but still it helps with performance of the application.

I hope that I have fully fulfilled your requirements and wishes according to the technical description. I also left small notes in the code to explain the code, where its logic is not obvious at first glance. In addition, you can view the project on the deployment page.

I would like to thank you the opportunity to show my skills within this project and hope to hear from you your fair feedback.
